        <p>Here at Sammon News, we value our audience and our integrity more than anything. To establish and
            contribute to this, we stand by a strict anti-misinformation policy in regards to providing clear and
            concise news. Sammon News is a corporation founded by a group of friends to further connect a friendship
            and further establish ourselves in an ever growing community. We already found ourselves to be fans of
            the core four entertainment industries: Film, Television, Music and Gaming, so we thought why not! And
            here we are today.</br></br>
            There are a million other Entertainment publications out there, so why choose us? We at Sammon News,
            cover news in a timely manner, dedicated and competent reporters, and engage with our audience and
            community on a regular basis. Furthermore, we have dedicated writers and editors for the four
            entertainment industries (and more!) to ensure a complete coverage of any news you may want to stay up
            to date with!</p>
